			  Look at the ACME Company Customer Dashboard.

				 <summary>Target Solution</summary>
				 The <a href="/acme-company/customer-dashboard">ACME Company Customer Dashboard</a> contains a cryptic message to customers which you must decode.

			  What kind of code do you think the customer dashboard uses? Do you think it is actually "state of the art" encryption?

			  <details>
				 <summary>Flag Hint 1</summary>

				 The code is a Caesar Cipher.

				 <details>
					<summary>Flag Hint 2</summary>

					Caesar ciphers a very vulnerable to brute force attacks, and there are lots of free Caesar cipher brute force programs online: <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher">like this one</a>.

					<details>
					    <summary>Flag Hint 3</summary>
					    
					    The code on the ACME Company Customer Dashboard is a Caesar Cipher. This type of cipher was invented a very long time ago. Encryption has improved a lot since then... Due to Caesar Cipher's small key space they are very vulnerable to brute force attacks.
					    <br /><br />
					    An attacker can easily crack a Caesar Cipher by trying all possibly keys, and then see which decrypted results contain English words. This is a simple coding exercise if you would like to try. <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher">This online tool also performs this process</a>. Simply enter the secret code into the "Caesar shifted ciphertext" field. Click the "Test all possible shifts (brute-force attack)" check box. Then hit the "Decrypt Caesar Code" button. Wait a few seconds and on the left there will be a list of all the brute forced results. Look through this list and you will see that the tool has automatically put results with English words at the top.
